# Objective
The exercise consists in implementing a simple text editor with a very specific feature related to links.

When thereâ€™s no caret in the notes, the keyboard is not visible:

You can navigate the document normally.
You also can tap on a link to open it.
If you tap on any other place than a link, the caret should be put at that location (or the closest possible), and the keyboard should open.
When the caret is displayed and the keyboard visible

You should be able to edit text normally, and also edit link like any normal text.
You also still can tap on any link to open it.
If you retract the keyboard, the caret should disappear.
If you click a link, the caret & the keyboard should disappear.
ðŸŽ¯ The goal is to provide something solid. We should not be able to break it in 2 minutes!
